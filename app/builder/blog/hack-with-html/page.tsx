          Hack NASA with HTML memes is a thing of 2020, but can you actually
          hack with HTML? Depends on how you define hack. The most popular
          definition I found was{" "}
          <strong className="text-red-500">gaining unauthorized access</strong>.
          Unauthorized however has a vague meaning,
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Do I have unrestricted access to my files on my computer? Yes. <br />
          Do I have access to something a website has given me? Depends. I can
          not download a movie from a paid subscription due to copyright issues,
          I can not use the console with some banking websites due to rules.
          But! most cool websites do not have rules! That is what makes hacking
          legal here!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 indent-5">
          So what do I mean by hacking with HTML? The webpage you get is HTML!
          (Maybe + javascript, but sourced from the HTML page, and hack with
          HTML rhymes a lot better :P). Legally, we can hack a webpage (gain
          access that is legal, but the website owner did not anticipate).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          What do I mean? Let us say you have a website which allows users to
          play a game. For eg, my {"friend's"} website,{" "}

          Here, the daily challenge requires you to solve 20 math questions and
          your score depends on the time you took. For every question, you need
          to enter the answer on their input box. It is your computer, HTML, and
          input, and they evaluate what you send. Now you can either type out
          the answer, or you can compute it! to get the below progress bar:

          We started the article talking about hacking with HTML, but was this
          hacking? Not exactly, because there is 0 unauthorized access. But,
          this is a grey area because the website developers did not expect me
          to gain this level of access.

        <p className="mt-2">
          My <strong className="text-red-500">goal</strong> is not to break the

          <strong className="text-red-500">
            ensure that the website can not be broken
          </strong>
          . So how do we do that? There are 2 solutions,

        <ol className="list-decimal	ml-7 mt-2 mb-2">
          <li className="mb-2">
            Play the{" "}
            <strong className="text-red-500">cat and mouse game</strong>. Make
            it harder to select the question block, or make a custom input
            element that only accepts keypress etc. I can further hack it by
            figuring out how to modify that input element because it is HTML on
            my laptop, it is my turf!

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Are either of these correct? No. But doing step 1 correctly can make
          step 2 a lot easier! So when you are making a website, you most
          probably will check for actual security threats but also check for
          HTML hackers!
